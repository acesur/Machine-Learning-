MELANOMA DETECTION USING SVM AND KNN ALGORITHMS
Project Title
Intelligent Skin Lesion Classification for Melanoma Detection: A Machine Learning Approach
1. Introduction
This project aims to develop an intelligent application prototype that applies machine learning techniques for the classification of skin lesions, with a particular focus on melanoma detection. By utilizing the HAM10000 dataset, various classification algorithms will be implemented and evaluated to create an effective diagnostic tool that could potentially assist healthcare professionals in early melanoma detection.
2. Background and Motivation
Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer globally, with melanoma being its deadliest variant. Early detection is crucial for survival rates, yet visual diagnosis can be challenging even for experienced dermatologists. Machine learning offers promising capabilities to assist in this diagnostic process, potentially improving accuracy and accessibility of skin lesion classification.
3. Dataset Description
The HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images") dataset contains dermatoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions across seven diagnostic categories:
•	Melanoma (MEL)
•	Melanocytic nevus (NV)
•	Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
•	Actinic keratosis / Bowen's disease (AKIEC)
•	Benign keratosis (BKL)
•	Dermatofibroma (DF)
•	Vascular lesion (VASC)
Dataset structure observed from your screenshot:
•	HAM10000_images_part_1 and HAM10000_images_part_2: Folders containing dermatoscopic images
•	HAM10000_metadata.csv: Metadata file with diagnostic labels and patient information
